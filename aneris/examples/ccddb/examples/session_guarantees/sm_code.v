   * The execution can be conceptualized as a
   * sequence of steps:
   *   - increment the sequence id
   *   - send an arbitrary message to a server
   *   - loop waiting for a reply from the server, using the sequence id to
   *     match the request we just sent to its response
   *   - return the server's response, minus the sequence id

  (*
   * Initializes the session manager.
   * Returns a tuple `(init_fn, read_fn, write_fn)` of closures containing
   * the init_session, read and write operations, respectively.
   *
   * Throughout all operations, we maintain a _sequence id_, a monotonically
   * increasing integer that counts the number of requests sent to the server
   * so far in the session.
   * Calls to init_session, reads and writes all increase the sequence id.
   *
   * Inits, reads and writes are synchronized with a lock to guarantee that the
   * sequence id observed by an operation remains the maximum among all
   * previously-seen sequence ids, throughout the
   * execution of the operation. This is important because we communicate over
   * UDP so there are no duplicate protection or ordering guarantees.
