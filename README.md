# Lawyer project

See `paper/README.md` for the installation instructions and code overview.
Note that the aforementioned file is intended to be used for the Lawyer paper submission and therefore describes the codebase obtained by running `paper/prepare_submission.sh`.

Once the paper is accepted, we'll update this README accordingly.
